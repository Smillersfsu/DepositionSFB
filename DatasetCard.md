# Dataset Card for Sediment Deposition Rates Across San Pablo Bay Marsh Vegetation 

## Dataset Description

Dataset is a summary of Dr. Karen Thorne's team at U.S. Geological Survey's work from 2022-2023 measuring differences in short term sediment deposition rates between Corte Madera Marsh and San Pablo National Wildlife Refuge. 
There were four transects in each marshland, two which were perpendicular to the bay marsh edge going upland, and two transects perpendicular to a tidal channel edge going across the marsh. 
Both the bay marsh edge and the tidal channel are known as aquatic sources of suspended sediment. 
Vegetation was also measured adjacent to each of the sediment deposition pads, taking into account the species and structural differences adjacent to different sediment differences. 

### Data Purpose 

Sediment accretion and deposition data can be used to assess sediment delivery to marshes and determine marsh resilience to sea-level rise.

## Project Description 

Monitoring stations were established along duplicate transects in two locations per marsh. At Corte Madera marsh in Corte Madera, CA, transects were laid at the marsh bay edge and at a tidal creek. At San Pablo National Wildlife Refuge, transects were laid at the marsh bay edge on either side of a large bisecting channel, with one location closer to the mouth of the Petaluma River in Sonoma, CA. Stations were spaced at increasing distance from the sediment source (e.g. marsh channel), ranging in total transect length from 30 - 150 m, depending on the marsh location.
At each location, two replicate transects were established, and each monitoring station consisted of sediment traps deployed in triplicate and a feldspar marker horizon (MH) plot. Sediment traps were 10 x 10 cm tiles secured into the ground using stakes, with borosilicate filter pads attached by crosshatched rubber bands. While deployed, sediment deposits on the pad, then the pad is collected, dried, and weighed to determine deposition (g). Sediment pads were collected monthly (approximately every 4 weeks, but length of deployment sometimes varied), and analyzed for total deposition and mineral and organic fractions. Elevations of all monitoring stations were measured with real-time kinetic (RTK) GPS. Monitoring occurred from May 2022 to August 2023, capturing over a full year of sediment data at both marshes, including different growing seasons and hydrological periods. We conducted vegetation surveys during both summers 2022 and 2023, and winter 2023 to survey dominant plant species, density, and elevations. At each monitoring station, we recorded species, percent cover, average height, and density. Vegetation density was determined by measuring average width of living and non-living steams and leaves, and measuring total stem length within plot. For Salicornia pacifica, one of two dominant species at San Pablo NWR, the stems were treated as cylinders. Therefore we measured stem width, number of stems, and height. The other dominant species at San Pablo is Spartina foliosa, where we also treated the stem as a cylinder, and the leaves as triangles, counting the average number of leaves per stem, leaf width, and length. Corte Madera has a patchwork of vegetation along the transects: Salicornia pacifica, Distichilis spicata, Jaumea carnosa, and Spartina foliosa. For both Distichilis and Jaumea, we counted the total number of stems, then measured the cumulative leaf length on 5 randomly selected stems to estimate total leaf length in the plot. For these species, we recorded average leaf width, and the stems as cylinders, so we recorded average stem width and length.
Sediment pads and cores were dried at 60 °C until they reached a constant weight. The dry weight of pads was used to calculate sediment flux (g/m2/day). The dry weights of the shallow core sections were used to calculate dry bulk density (g/m3). All sediment pads and shallow cores were burned in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 5 hours to calculate loss on ignition, a measurement for organic content of a given sample.
### Data Summary 

The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Ecological Research Center collected sediment and accretion data at two marshes in San Francisco Bay, California over the course of 15 months, capturing a full hydrological year and two spring-summer transitions. Sediment traps were deployed monthly in triplicate along transects of increasing distance from sediment sources (i.e., channels) to capture meter-scale spatial variability in sediment deposition and paired with feldspar marker horizons(MH) to measure long-term accretion. These data include sediment trap and MH plot locations, calculated sediment fluxes (g/m2/day) at each station by deployment period, annual accretion rates (mm/yr), and covariates associated with sediment deposition and accretion including vegetation and elevation. This project aimed to investigate variation in sediment deposition across spatiotemporal scales to provide insights into sediment delivery and marsh resilience to sea-level rise.
